    "reviewText": "This review is for the Amazon Gift Card (any amount) in the Mini Amazon Shipping Box:\n\nDo you get excited when your Amazon Shipment arrives at your door? The sight of the brown Amazon box & the excitement of getting a new delivery? If so, then you are going to LOVE the little gift box that this gift card comes in. I've ordered many of the Amazon tins, & some with the greeting cards, & this is one of my favorites!  It is Super Adorable, & a great way to give a gift card for any Amazon Fan!\n\nThe little brown box is about 4.5\" x 3\" x 1\" tall. The inside comes with a removable brown flap that holds the gift card perfectly.\n\nOpen the flap & it reveals the gift card inside. The top flaps seem like they are magnetic because when you go to reclose they snap back into place. The bottom has a clear window that allows you to see inside. Small print on the back- Amazon Gift cards, made in China. I chose the \"Thank you\" gift card. (see attached pics). This little gift box comes free with the purchase of your gift card. You can reuse it, or swap out the gift card if you choose.\n\nIt arrives with inside an outer box, so it should arrive safe & sound.\n\nWould it make a great gift? Definitely!  Amazon is a great card to give because there are So many choices of what to spend it on. Unlike other gift cards where you are stuck to a particular retailer/restaurant. etc, this gives you a variety. I like purchasing gift cards in $25 quantities so I can have a quick gift in hand just in case I need a quick or unexpected gift.\n\nRecommended for:  I recommend this for anyone who loves shopping on Amazon. If you or your gift recipient love getting that Amazon brown box delivery, then you will be giddy when you see this adorable box!\n\nIdeas: You can purchase this & swap out the gift cards. So, for example, it doesnt appear they are still offering the thank you card with this box (like when I bought it).  You could purchase one of the other \"thank you\" gift cards (in box, card, etc), & then purchase a one of these mini box ones & swap the 2 cards. Or use 1 of the gift cards for yourself for future purchases.\n\nAt the time I'm writing this review, it appears you can purchase the gift cards in $25-$2000 amounts. There are 2 posts for this particular mini box style with birthday icons & classic white gift card offerings.\n\nLove this little brown box & I will be ordering more. 5 Stars. Happy Shopping! :)",
